# My Portfolio

This is where you'll find a brief description of who I am, my projects, and contact information. It was re-built using react, if you want to see the old one just click [here.](https://github.com/iMadfxq/myOwnWebPage)

## Features

- Built using React-DOM + Redux.
- It will show you in the header the section where you currently are.
- The all projects section can filter the projects depending on tags.
- In the homepage it features a random quote carousel, that shows some quotes that I consider of value.
- When viewing on a mobile device, it will use a burger menu to show links (first time I implemented one).
- I have videos for the languages that I say that I speak, just click the flag.
